## Repo Rules
In order to have an orderly work methodology, some points are requested to be followed:

- Before to do a modification or development in a script, you must to create a new issue and give it a name. 

- Later you have to create a new brach, name the new branch as follows: #issue/name-of-the-issue.

For example, if the issue is called "Script.py debug fix" and its issue number is "3". The brach must be name "3/Script.py-debug-fix". 

- Once you have created a new branch, switch to it. 

*Note: NEVER make modifications to the main branch, please be careful and always make sure you are on an alternate branch*

- Then, you are done! Do your development.
